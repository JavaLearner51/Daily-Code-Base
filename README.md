# NOTE
In case you just want to contribute a question and not code, there is no need to do so many things, just open an issue with the topic Problem Submission and the problem in the comments. I'll add it myself, and will give you proper credits ðŸ˜ƒ

# Disclaimer
I do not own the rights to the questions I will discuss in this Daily Codes initiative. The questions have been collected from various sources and I do not know who created all those questions. If you think you are the owner of any question or any code, just start an issue, I will be more than happy to give the appropriate credits.
