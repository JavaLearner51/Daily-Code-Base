# Day 3 -- The Hamming Distance Problem

The Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.

It measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other or the minimum number of errors that could have transformed one string into the other.

**Question**- Given 2 strings, we will find the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different.

**Example**

```
The hamming distance between
- "karolin" and "kathrin" is 3
- "karolin" and "kerstin" is 3
- 1011101 and 1001001 is 2
- 2173896 and 2233796 is 3
```

# Why Hamming Distance?
The #1 reason for not being successful is inconsistency, and it is a common trend that people start something and on give up on the third day itself, and one of the major reasons behind that is that they find it difficult to continue.  So, to keep everyone (who is following the DailyCodes challenge) consistent, I have decided to keep today's question very simple and straightforward.
